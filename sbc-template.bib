abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), in particular 3SAT with its bounded clause size, is a well-studied problem since a wide range of decision problems can be reduced to it. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for solving 3SAT for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices in the near future due to its simple quantum ansatz. However, although QAOA generally exhibits a high approximation ratio, there are 3SAT problem instances where the algorithm’s success probability when obtaining a satisfying variable assignment from the approximated solution drops sharply compared to the approximation ratio. To address this problem, in this paper, we present variants of the algorithm that are inspired by the amplitude amplification algorithm to improve the success probability for 3SAT. For this, (i) three amplitude amplification-inspired QAOA variants are introduced and implemented, (ii) the variants are experimentally compared with a standard QAOA implementation, and (iii) the impact on the success probability and ansatz complexity is analyzed. The experiment results show that an improvement in the success probability can be achieved with only a moderate increase in circuit complexity.}

abstract="Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is a fundamental problem in computer science. Finding efficient algorithms for SAT solving has broad implications in many areas of computer science and beyond. Quantum SAT solvers have been proposed in the literature based on Grover's algorithm. Although existing quantum SAT solvers can consider all possible inputs at once, they evaluate each clause in the formula one by one sequentially, making the time complexity O(m), linear to the number of clauses m, per Grover iteration. In this work, we develop a parallel quantum SAT solver, which reduces the time complexity in each iteration to constant time O(1) by utilising extra entangled qubits. To further improve the scalability of our solution in case of extremely large problems, we develop a distributed version of the proposed parallel SAT solver based on quantum teleportation such that the total qubits required are shared and distributed among a set of quantum computers (nodes), and the quantum SAT solving is accomplished collaboratively by all the nodes. We prove the correctness of our approaches and evaluate them in simulations and real quantum computers.",

abstract = {Combinatorial problems usually have a large search space, and almost all classical algorithms for solving this class of problems are inefficient for real-life input sizes. Quantum algorithms have been introduced with the aim of reducing computational time. In addition, to speed up the computation while solving combinatorial problems, another approach is to reduce the search space and focus on a restricted area. In this work, we study a parameter that helps reduce the search space for the solution to the satisfiability problem (SAT). We propose an approach based on Grover’s algorithm that considers the defined parameter to reduce the search space for the solution of the SAT problem. Our algorithm has a complexity of the order O(N/S), or O(N/lS) if there are l good solutions among the initial solutions, with N the number of potential solutions and S the reduction or subdivision factor of the space.}
